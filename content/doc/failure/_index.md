## What are they?

During your time as a PhD you will likely experience:
- your papers, fellowships, and grants being accepted/rejected;
- honors, awards, and jobs you are qualified for being given to you/others; 
- and your thoughts, ideas, and values being praised/criticized.

These positive/negative experiences feel personal and, if given the power, can situate how we feel belonging in the broader community of academics.
This, is a trap.

Externalities are the entropy of academic growth and research life.

## Identity

## resilience, persistence, perseverence
