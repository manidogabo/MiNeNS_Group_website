## Success and Failure: What are they? and Who choses? 

During your time in academia you will likely experience:
- your papers, fellowships, and grants being rejected;
- honors, awards, and jobs you are qualified for being given to others; 
- and your thoughts, ideas, and values being criticized.

These negative experiences feel personal and, if given the power, can situate how we feel belonging in the broader community of academics.

Externalities are the entropy of academic growth and research life.

## Identity

## resilience, persistence, perseverence
