The **MInEnS Lab** is an academic group that is defined by a PI, trainees, and the network of relationships amongst our members. 
Thus, we each have personal responsibilities to build positive relationships at the personal and group levels.
These expectations aim to set the foundation that guides our roles in an up-front and clear manner. 

## My expectations for trainees

### time and space
One of the benefits of a research position is the day-to-day flexibility that accompanies working on a long-term project. In many ways, this means that you can choose when and where you work. Still, there are some expectations and best practices that benefit us individually and collaboratively.
- Best practices:
    - In-office/lab between standard hours (_i.e._ ~10am-3pm) for both convenient and natural interactions with the group.
- Expecations
    - In-person attendance to group, subgroup, and 1:1 meetings when possible.
### communication
### growth
The _end-product_ of your time as a trainee in the group is **YOU**. While events like graduation will mark a specific date of accomplishment, your journey happens everyday in-between joining and leaving the goup. Thus, there is a continual expectation to develop yourself in the group. These include:
- developing your techincal skills and knowledge,
- making incremental progress on your research, 
- improving as a mentor, teacher, and citizen of the group
