## *Pseudo*-values 
I would be remiss to discuss the common conflation between external measures and values. I call these external measures, "*pseudo*-values", because I believe that (1) they are biproducts o true values and (2) if they are valued on their own we fall into the trap of valuing **Power** and **Product**. 
### Publications
Sometimes refered to as the *currency* of academica, the drive for impact is what leads to the publish-or-perish culture that pervades academia. 
### Awards
Awards, fellowships, honors, are recognitions of our work and activities. While I believe most everyone awarded deserves their recognition, the reality is there are typically more qualified individuals than there are suitable recognitions. Further, being recognized does not increase our personal value nor does being denied decrease our personal value. 
### Competition 

*Ever tried. \
&emsp; Ever failed. \
No matter. \
Try again. \
&emsp; Fail again. \
Fail better.* - Samuel Beckett
