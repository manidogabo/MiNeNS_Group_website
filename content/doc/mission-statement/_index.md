The **MInEnS Lab** is an academic group that is defined by a PI, trainees, and the network of relationships amongst our members. 
Thus, we each have personal responsibilities to build positive relationships at the personal and group levels.
These expectations aim to set the foundation that guides our roles in an up-front and clear manner.
