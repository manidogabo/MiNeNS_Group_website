## Structure

The <span style="color:#F3B26D;font-variant-caps:small-caps;font-weight:200">**MInEnS** Lab</span> is an academic group consisting of a PI and trainees. We are defined bt the network of relationships amongst our members, with our community, and with the world. 
Thus, we each have personal responsibilities to build positive relationships at the personal and group levels.
These expectations aim to set the foundation that guides our roles in an up-front and clear manner.
