Boozhoo!  
I am an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.
My work focuses on the adaptation of *everyday* and soft matter physics to inspire, inform, and design new technologies. 
This curiosity-driven research aims to develop predictive models of nonlinear systems inspired by mechanical instabilities, biology, and art.
On the day-to-day you will find me using bubbles and balloons or beads and string as a craftman's tools to build new materials.
